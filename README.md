A CLI implementation of pente. 

[Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente)

## Game Rules
You can find the rules of the game by following the wikipedia link at the top of this page. Our implementation will start and by default use the pro rule set for two players. 

## Starting Out
Here is a guide to start off with this project: [Link](https://github.com/cstainsby/CliPente/blob/main/DanDevDocs.md)


## Future Development
Other Ideas that may be worth developing/looking into.
1. Addition of other rulesets, or even broader, an abstracted game model which can take number of players, game rules, as well as other game settings.
1. Etiquette rules, like chess with announcing checks, rules in this game dictate you may require you to announce when you place a three-in-a-row or four-in-a-row.
